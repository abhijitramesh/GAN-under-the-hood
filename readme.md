# Applications of GANs

---

## StackGan Model

This model takes in a description of a bird and generates a high-resolution image of a bird matching that description. These are images that have not been seen before which means the gan is not searching for an image in a set of images but generates a new image.

## IGAN

These Gan helps artist when a doodle is drawn using a mouse these GANs translate them to images

## Pix2Pix

The GANs take input of an image in one domain and convert them to images in other domains for examples blueprints of building can be changed to images of buildings or drawings of cat can be turned into images of cats.

## Cartoon GANs

These GANs generate cartoon face given a normal face, these GANs were trained on faces of people and cartoon faces but they were not told what image is mapped to what.

## Cycle GANS

These GANs also uses unsupervised learning they can do things like take in a video of a horse and convert it to a video of a zebra , since they are using unsupervised learning they not only convert the horse object but also some parts of the background since they are using unsupervised learning.

## Simulated Training

GANs can take in input of 3d or 2d models and create realistic datasets which can be used as training dataset for image recognition tools.
